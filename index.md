I am a research-based master's student in Hydrology at Colorado School of Mines working with Dr. Terri Hogue.  My research is in river temperature and hydraulic modeling for river restoration.

# Research

My thesis research focuses on analysis and prediction of river temperatures.  I am currently working on generating a suitable dataset for further study.

Since June 2019, I have worked on the [Los Angeles River Environmental Flows Project](https://www.sccwrp.org/about/research-areas/ecohydrology/los-angeles-river-flows-project/), primarily as a hydraulic modeler.  The project's original goal was to investigate the impacts of increased wastewater recycling on ecology and recreational uses in the Los Angeles River, which, in the dry season, is mostly wastewater.  We are now working on restoration scenarios to mitigate the impact of wastewater recycling and other flow changes.  For the project, I assembled a HEC-RAS model from existing partial models and LIDAR data, calibrated the model, and used the model as well as a suite of utility scripts I developed to efficiently analyze a large range of hydrologic and hydraulic scenarios.  As a spinoff project, I developed an automatic calibration utility for HEC-RAS, [Raspy-Cal](https://raspy-cal.dphilippus.com/).

## Selected Publications & Conferences

* [Raspy-Cal: A Genetic Algorithm-Based Automatic Calibration Tool for HEC-RAS Hydraulic Models](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/13/21/3061) (Philippus, Wolfand, Abdi, and Hogue, 2021; DOI:10.3390/w13213061) describes the implementation of the HEC-RAS automatic calibration utility I developed and a case study with it.  I also presented on this at the AGU Fall Meeting 2020 in an eLightning format.

# Background & Education

I am focusing my master's degree coursework on modeling and computation.  My undergraduate education, also at Colorado School of Mines, was in Civil Engineering, with specialized coursework on water resources, geotechnical engineering, and surveying.  In addition to my research with the Hogue Group, which I began after my sophomore year, I interned at Kilduff Underground Engineering, primarily as a geotechnical monitoring survey technician, though I also ran pipe jacking load calculations for trenchless tunneling projects.

# Skills

I have professional experience with hydraulic modeling, software development (particularly for data processing automation), GIS and remote sensing, and surveying, and am particularly familiar with HEC-RAS, R, Python, ArcMap (including ArcPy), and Google Earth Engine.  I also have course-related lab experience with river gaging, distributed temperature sensing, infiltration tests, geophysical surveys, MODFLOW, Hydrus, AutoCAD Civil3D, and HEC-HMS, and with implementing numerical models.
